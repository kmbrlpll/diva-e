## **Backend Readme**

#### **How to create flask project**
I would advice to have a look to the first link bellow in "useful links". 
Bellow is written short sequence of steps taken from the manual.

`$ python3 -m venv venv` -- create virtual environment.

`$ venv\Scripts\activate` Activate virtual environment in **Windows**. 
If everything is ok, than should appear (venv) before the cursor, like `(venv) $ _`

For **Linux / Mac** activation of venv is like this: `$ source venv/bin/activate`.

After that it should be additional packages installed. The first package is flask itself: `$ pip install flask`.

#### **How to run flask server**
`$ flask run` in commandline. 

#### **How to run SQLAlchemy ORM  locally** ###
To run the SQLAlchemy ORM DB locally, `$ FLASK_APP=app.py` has to be set.
As the `$ versions` folder under `$ migrations`is empty and will be missing in GitLab, `$ migrations`should be deleted initially.
Afterwards, run `$ flask db init`. This will generate the said `$migrations`and `$versions`subfolder again, plus corresponding dependencies.
'$ flask db migrate`will generate automatic migrations for the database, as there is no previous one.
To apply changes to the database, run Â´$ flask db downgrade` to revert or `$ flask db upgrade`to upgrade.

Examples can be run in the Python shell, enter with `$ python`. 
Run: 
* `$ python`
* `$from app import db ` 
* `$ from app.models import Office, Room, Window, Heater`
* `$ u = Office(office_name_='john', office_address='test', path_to_floorplan='some/path/')`
* `$ db.session.add(u)`
* `$ db.session.commit()`
* `$ exit()`


#### **Packages to install**
Installation of packages: `$ pip install package-name` in commandline.

Ofc "package-name" is just a placeholder which we should replace with given bellow package names. For example: `$ pip install flask`.
* flask
* paho-mqtt
* flask-sqlalchemy
* flask-migrate
* flask-socketio -- this is temporal package, will be removed so there is no need to install it.

#### **Description of directories**
* app.py -- entry point of the entire app
* app/__init__ -- Init files are intended to behave directory as a package 
* app/mqtt_controller.py -- there should be all the things that are working with mqtt
* app/models.py -- Just models. All JSON routine should be done there.
* app/api/configurations.py -- routes for configurations (api/configuration/things)
* app/api/states.py -- routes for states of things
* app/api/tokens.py -- there should be some token routine

#### **IDEs**
I would recommend **PyCharm** community edition. It is very powerful and free. 
Behaves like Eclipse in Java and has some cool features like automatically activating venv and integrated interaction with git.  
Controversial this IDE needs some time to get used to.  
I would at least give a try.

On other hand **VSCode** with installed python plugins is also a good choice.

#### **Useful links**

* https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-i-hello-world
The first part of big flask tutorial. There is described the first setup of flask project.
The important part is to create and manage own virtual environment, so project libraries will be isolated from the global
python environment. venv order should be gitignored and doesn't appear in git.
Also there is described how to install additional packages, through the pip.

* https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-xxiii-application-programming-interfaces-apis
The last part of the given tutorial that describes how to write an API in flask.

* https://randomnerdtutorials.com/esp8266-publishing-dht22-readings-with-mqtt-to-raspberry-pi/
This link describes how flask interacts with MQTT.
